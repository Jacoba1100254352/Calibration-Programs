### **Maximizing Efficiency: Reducing Bit Resolution**

Reducing bit resolution can lead to significant savings in memory and computational resources, especially when deploying models on hardware
with limited capabilities (like microcontrollers). However, it's crucial to balance efficiency with the integrity of your data to avoid
compromising model performance.

#### **1. Understanding the Trade-offs**

- **Higher Bit-Width (e.g., 14 bits for Instron):**
    - **Pros:** Higher precision, better representation of subtle changes in data.
    - **Cons:** Increased memory usage and computational overhead.

- **Lower Bit-Width (e.g., 8-12 bits):**
    - **Pros:** Reduced memory footprint, faster computations, lower power consumption.
    - **Cons:** Potential loss of precision, which might affect model accuracy.

#### **2. Recommended Bit-Width Adjustments**

##### **Instron Data**

- **Current:** 14 bits
- **Recommendation:** **12 bits**
    - **Rationale:**
        - **12 bits** provide **4096 levels**, resulting in a step size of approximately **0.000244**, which is still below the current
          precision requirement (**~0.0001**).
        - This slight reduction maintains most of the precision while offering better efficiency.

    - **Potential Impact:**
        - **Minimal:** Given the dynamic range and precision, reducing to 12 bits should retain essential data characteristics.
        - **Action:** Test the model performance with 12-bit quantization to ensure acceptable accuracy.

##### **Arduino Data**

- **Current:** 11 bits
- **Recommendation:** **10 bits**
    - **Rationale:**
        - **10 bits** provide **1024 levels**, resulting in a step size of approximately **0.000977**, which is slightly above the current
          precision (**~0.000517**).
        - Considering the dynamic range, this step size is still within an acceptable range for many applications.

    - **Potential Impact:**
        - **Moderate:** There might be a slight loss in precision, but it can be mitigated with appropriate scaling or calibration.
        - **Action:** Validate the model's performance with 10-bit quantization to ensure it meets your accuracy requirements.

#### **3. Techniques to Maintain Data Integrity**

- **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):**
    - Integrate quantization during the training phase to help the model learn weights that are robust to lower bit representations.

- **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ):**
    - Apply quantization after training, adjusting weights and activations to fit the desired bit-width without retraining.

- **Dynamic Range Scaling:**
    - Adjust the scale of your data to maximize the utilization of the available bit range, minimizing quantization errors.

- **Mixed-Precision Quantization:**
    - Use higher bit-widths for layers or parameters that are more sensitive to precision loss and lower bit-widths elsewhere.

    - **Proposed Reduction:** **12 bits**
        - **Rationale:** 12 bits provide **4,096 levels**, offering a step size of approximately **0.000244**, which is still below your
          required precision of **~0.0001**.
        - **Expected Impact:** Minimal precision loss, maintaining data integrity while reducing memory usage.

2. **Arduino Data:**
    - **Current Bit-Width:** 11 bits
    - **Proposed Reduction:** **10 bits**
        - **Rationale:** 10 bits provide **1,024 levels**, resulting in a step size of approximately **0.000977**, which is slightly above
          your current precision requirement of **~0.000517**.
        - **Expected Impact:** Slight precision loss, but likely acceptable given the dynamic range. Validation is necessary to ensure model
          performance remains unaffected.

#### **Techniques to Maintain Data Integrity:**

  without retraining.
- **Dynamic Range Scaling:** Adjust the scale of your data to maximize the utilization of the available bit range, minimizing quantization
  errors.
- **Mixed-Precision Quantization:** Use higher bit-widths for layers or parameters that are more sensitive to precision loss and lower
  bit-widths elsewhere.

### **B. Neural Fit Calculation Approach**

Your **Neural Fit** methodology involves calculating the total number of multipliers, adders, and memory costs based on the network's
architecture and bit-widths. Here's an evaluation of your approach:

#### **One-Shot Calculations vs. Segmented Calculations**

1. **One-Shot (All at Once):**
    - **Pros:**
        - Simpler implementation.
        - Easier to parallelize.
    - **Cons:**
        - May not accurately account for variations across layers.
        - Potentially higher memory spikes during computation.

2. **Segmented (Layer-wise):**
    - **Pros:**
        - More accurate representation of computational requirements per layer.
        - Better scalability and resource management.
    - **Cons:**

    - **Memory Cost:** 49,408 multipliers * 10 bits = 494,080 bits (~61.76 KB)

This adjustment ensures that each dataset's unique bit-width requirements are accurately reflected in your computational and memory
estimates.

### **C. Example Calculation Based on Your Model**

      precision does not adversely affect accuracy.
    - **Arduino:** Test reducing bit-width from **11 bits** to **10 bits**. Similarly, validate to confirm that the precision loss remains
      within acceptable limits.

2. **Adopt Segmented Neural Fit Calculations:**
    - Calculate multipliers, adders, and memory costs **per layer** rather than aggregating all at once. This approach enhances accuracy and
      facilitates better optimization, especially when dealing with varying bit-widths across datasets.

3. **Validate Model Performance Post-Quantization:**
    - After implementing bit-width reductions, perform thorough testing to ensure that the neural network maintains its predictive
      performance.

      potentially mitigating accuracy loss.
    - **Mixed-Precision Quantization:** Apply higher precision where necessary and lower precision elsewhere to optimize overall performance
      without uniformly compromising on precision.

5. **Ensure Hardware Compatibility:**
    - Verify that your target deployment hardware supports the desired bit-widths and quantization schemes.
    - Utilize specialized libraries or frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile) that offer built-in support for quantization and
      optimized neural network deployments.

6. **Leverage Dynamic Range Scaling:**
    - Adjust the scale of your data inputs to maximize the effective use of the available bit range, minimizing quantization errors and
      preserving data integrity.

---

By following these recommendations, you can effectively optimize your neural network's computational and memory footprint through bit-width
reductions while maintaining the integrity and performance of your calibration models. Always ensure to validate each change to uphold the
quality and reliability of your application.

If you have further questions or need assistance with specific implementation steps, feel free to ask!

It seems you're aiming to compare **polyfit** and **neural fit** in the most accurate and fair way possible, ideally in the **calibration
process**. To clarify and guide your decision-making process, let's break this down:

### 1. **Comparing Polyfit vs. Neural Fit**

The comparison you're making could be done at two different stages:

- **During Calibration**: Comparing how polyfit and neural fit perform in calibrating the raw Arduino sensor data against the reference
  Instron data. This would give you a clear understanding of how each method adjusts or calibrates the sensor data.
- **During Analysis**: After calibration, comparing how well both fits explain the calibrated data by analyzing residuals and errors
  post-calibration.

**Recommendation**:  
It would be best to compare **polyfit vs. neural fit** during the **calibration process** itself. The primary reason is that calibration is
where the model (whether polyfit or neural fit) learns to map the sensor readings to the reference readings (Instron). Comparing their
performance during calibration directly answers the question: *Which method is better at calibrating the sensor data?*

Once you move past calibration into analysis (residuals, error analysis, etc.), you're evaluating a secondary aspect: how well the
calibration holds up. But this doesn't reflect the fundamental capability of each method to perform the calibration task itself.

---

### 2. **One-Shot vs. Segmented Calculations**

- **One-Shot Calculation**: In this approach, you treat the entire dataset as a whole and apply the fitting process (either polyfit or
  neural fit) in one go. This means that you fit one function (or neural network) to map the entire set of data in a single pass.
    - **Pros**:
        - Simpler implementation.
        - Easier to parallelize.
        - Efficient for smaller datasets.
    - **Cons**:
        - May not account for variations in data across different regions.
        - Potentially higher memory usage during computation.

- **Segmented Calculation (Layer-wise for Neural Networks or Piecewise for Polyfit)**: This method breaks the data into segments (either
  based on layers in neural networks or using piecewise functions for polyfit) and fits a function to each segment. For neural networks, it
  may mean optimizing each layer or section individually.
    - **Pros**:
        - Provides more granular control over fitting, which can lead to more accurate results in cases where data behavior differs across
          regions.
        - Better for handling larger datasets or varying data.
    - **Cons**:
        - More complex to implement.
        - Requires additional tracking of calculations per segment/layer.

**Recommendation for your case**:  
Since your goal is to **compare polyfit and neural fit in the calibration process** and you want the comparison to be **fair and consistent
**, using a **segmented approach** for both polyfit and neural fit would be the best choice. This approach allows for a more granular and
accurate representation of each method's strengths in handling the different behaviors of your data.

---

### 3. **Evaluating Which Process to Use**

Given the current code, you're already using **polyfit** for calibration in a straightforward manner. For **neural fit**, you're using it
mostly in post-calibration analysis. However, if you want to make a more direct comparison, you should bring neural fit into the calibration
process itself.

- For **polyfit**:
    - It fits a polynomial function to map the raw Arduino sensor data to the reference Instron data. This is a **traditional regression
      approach**.

- For **neural fit**:
    - A neural network can be used similarly, where the input is the raw sensor data, and the output is the calibrated (Instron) data. The
      neural network learns this mapping.

**Steps for Fair Comparison**:

1. **Modify the Calibration Step**: In your `calculate_coefficients()` function, introduce neural fit alongside polyfit. For each sensor,
   instead of just fitting a linear model (via polyfit), you could also train a neural network to map the raw Arduino force data to the
   Instron force data.

2. **Apply the Same Process to Both**: Ensure that the **data normalization**, **data segmentation**, and **error calculations** are
   identical for both methods. This will allow you to directly compare the residuals, errors, and fit quality of polyfit vs. neural fit.

3. **Use the Same Metrics for Evaluation**: During calibration, compare:
    - **Residuals**: The difference between the fitted value (from polyfit or neural fit) and the actual reference (Instron) value.
    - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** or **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: These metrics can provide a quantitative measure of the
      calibration accuracy for both methods.

4. **Graph the Results for Direct Comparison**: Plot the results of both polyfit and neural fit calibrations (similar to your residual
   graphs) and compare their performance in fitting the calibration data.

---

### 4. **Next Steps in Code Implementation**

Here’s an outline of how you might adapt the `calculate_coefficients()` function to include neural fit alongside polyfit:

```python
def calculate_coefficients():
	"""
	Calculate new calibration coefficients for all sensors and compare polyfit vs neural fit.
	"""
	new_polyfit_coefficients = []
	new_neural_fit_coefficients = []
	
	for sensor_num in SENSORS_RANGE:
		# Read data from CSV files
		instron_data = read_csv(get_data_filepath(ALIGNED_INSTRON_DIR, sensor_num))
		aligned_arduino_data = read_csv(get_data_filepath(ALIGNED_ARDUINO_DIR, sensor_num))

```

## **1. Understanding the Calibration Process**

### **A. Objectives:**

- **Calibration Goal:** Map raw Arduino sensor data (e.g., ADC readings) to accurate reference measurements from the Instron device.
- **Comparison Focus:** Evaluate **polyfit** (polynomial regression) vs. **neural fit** (neural network regression) in their ability to
  perform accurate calibrations.

### **B. Key Steps in Your Workflow:**

1. **Data Acquisition:** Collect raw data from Arduino and reference data from Instron.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Convert raw data to CSV, align, trim, and truncate as needed.
3. **Calibration:**
    - **Polyfit:** Apply linear or polynomial regression to map Arduino data to Instron data.
    - **Neural Fit:** Train a neural network to learn the mapping from Arduino data to Instron data.
4. **Application of Calibration:** Use the calibrated models to adjust Arduino readings.
5. **Analysis & Visualization:** Plot residuals, errors, and compare the performance of both calibration methods.

---

## **2. Selecting and Preparing Training Data**

### **A. Importance of Training Data Quality:**

- **Accuracy:** The calibration model's performance heavily depends on the quality and alignment of the training data.
- **Alignment:** Ensures that each Arduino reading corresponds precisely to the Instron measurement at the same instance.

### **B. Recommended Training Data Characteristics:**

1. **Aligned Data:**
    - **Time Alignment:** Ensure that Arduino and Instron data points are synchronized in time.
    - **Data Pairing:** Each Arduino reading should have a corresponding Instron measurement.

2. **Sufficient Coverage:**
    - **Dynamic Range:** The training data should cover the entire range of forces you expect to measure.
    - **Variability:** Include data points that capture different force levels and conditions to make the model robust.

3. **Clean Data:**
    - **Noise Reduction:** Remove outliers and smooth the data to minimize measurement noise.
    - **Consistency:** Ensure consistent sampling rates and data formats.

### **C. Steps to Prepare Training Data:**

1. **Data Alignment:**
    - **Trimming and Truncating:** As you’ve implemented, ensure that the data is trimmed to relevant force ranges and truncated to
      consistent lengths.
    - **Interpolation (if necessary):** If Arduino and Instron data have different sampling rates, interpolate one to match the other.

2. **Data Splitting:**
    - **Training Set:** Typically 70-80% of the data used to train the models.
    - **Validation/Test Set:** 20-30% of the data used to evaluate model performance.

3. **Data Normalization/Standardization:**
    - **Scaling Inputs and Outputs:** Use `StandardScaler` or similar to normalize data, which is crucial for neural networks to converge
      effectively.

### **D. Answering Your Specific Questions:**

#### **i. What data should I use for training?**

- **Use Aligned and Corrected Data:** Your training data should consist of Arduino readings and their corresponding Instron measurements
  that are properly aligned in time and have been preprocessed (trimmed, truncated, cleaned).
- **Consistency Across Tests:** If calibrating multiple tests or sensors, ensure each dataset is treated consistently in terms of
  preprocessing and alignment.

#### **ii. How should I use it?**

- **Pairwise Mapping:** Treat each Arduino reading as an input (`X_train`) and the corresponding Instron measurement as the target (
  `y_train`).
- **Model Training:**
    - **Polyfit:** Fit a polynomial regression model using the entire training set to find coefficients that map `X_train` to `y_train`.
    - **Neural Fit:** Train a neural network using `X_train` as inputs and `y_train` as outputs, ensuring that the network learns the
      mapping accurately.

#### **iii. What implications are there based on the data I provide?**

- **Model Performance:**
    - **Accurate Calibration:** Well-aligned and comprehensive training data will lead to better calibration models.
    - **Generalization:** Diverse and representative training data ensures that the models generalize well to new, unseen data.
- **Comparison Validity:** To fairly compare polyfit and neural fit, both models must be trained on the exact same dataset, ensuring that
  any performance differences are due to the models themselves, not the data.

#### **iv. Does the training data need to be already aligned/correct data or can it just be some other data that I have that would also need
to be calibrated?**

- **Training Data Must Be Aligned and Correct:**
    - **Essential for Calibration:** Calibration models learn the relationship between Arduino and Instron data. If the training data is
      misaligned or incorrect, the models will learn faulty mappings, leading to poor calibration.
    - **Preprocessing Dependency:** Ensure all training data undergoes the same preprocessing steps (alignment, trimming, etc.) before being
      used to train the models.

---

## **3. Implementing Calibration Methods**

### **A. Polyfit Calibration**

#### **Process:**

1. **Fit a Polynomial:**
    - Use `np.polyfit` to find polynomial coefficients that map Arduino readings to Instron measurements.
    - Example for linear fit (degree=1):
      ```python
      m, b = np.polyfit(arduino_raw_force, instron_force, 1)
      ```
2. **Apply the Fit:**
    - Calibrate Arduino data using the fitted polynomial:
      ```python
      calibrated_force = m * arduino_raw_force + b
      ```

### **B. Neural Fit Calibration**

#### **Process:**

1. **Build the Neural Network:**
    - Use your `build_neural_network` function to create a model architecture suitable for regression.
    - Example:
      ```python
      model = build_neural_network(input_dim=1, layers=4, units=128, activation='tanh', dropout_rate=0.2, l2_reg=0.0001, learning_rate=0.0001)
      ```
2. **Train the Model:**
    - Fit the neural network using the training data:
      ```python
      model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=200, batch_size=256, verbose=0, callbacks=[early_stopping])
      ```
3. **Apply the Fit:**
    - Predict calibrated force values:
      ```python
      fitted_values_scaled = model.predict(X_train)
      fitted_values = output_scaler.inverse_transform(fitted_values_scaled)
      ```

---

## **4. Ensuring a Fair and Accurate Comparison**

### **A. Consistent Preprocessing:**

- **Uniform Steps:** Ensure that both polyfit and neural fit models are trained on identically preprocessed data.
- **Same Training/Test Splits:** Use the same data partitions for both methods to maintain comparability.

### **B. Evaluation Metrics:**

- **Use Identical Metrics:** Evaluate both models using the same metrics, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
  or R-squared.
- **Residual Analysis:** Plot residuals for both methods to visually assess calibration accuracy.

### **C. Segmented vs. One-Shot Calibration:**

- **One-Shot (All at Once):**
    - **Pros:** Simpler, easier to implement, and consistent across methods.
    - **Cons:** May not capture localized variations in data.
- **Segmented (Layer-wise):**
    - **Pros:** Can handle variations in different data regions more effectively.
    - **Cons:** More complex and requires consistent segmentation criteria across both methods.

**Recommendation:**  
For a **fair comparison**, adopt the **one-shot approach** for both polyfit and neural fit. This ensures that both methods operate under
identical conditions, making the comparison based solely on their inherent capabilities.

If you choose to use segmented calibration, ensure that the segmentation strategy is identical for both methods to maintain fairness.

### **D. Code Integration for Fair Comparison:**

#### **1. Calibration Coefficients Calculation:**

Modify your calibration function to compute both polyfit and neural fit coefficients:

```python
def calculate_calibration_coefficients():
	"""
    Calculate calibration coefficients for all sensors using both polyfit and neural fit.
    """
	polyfit_coefficients = []
	neural_fit_models = []

		instron_force_scaled = input_scaler.fit_transform(instron_force.reshape(-1, 1))
		arduino_force_scaled = output_scaler.fit_transform(arduino_raw_force.reshape(-1, 1))
		
		# Build and train the neural network
		model = build_neural_network(input_dim=1, layers=4, units=128, activation='tanh', dropout_rate=0.2, l2_reg=0.0001, learning_rate=0.0001)

		model.fit(instron_force_scaled, arduino_force_scaled, epochs=200, batch_size=256, verbose=0, callbacks=[early_stopping])
		
		# Save the model and scalers for later use
		neural_fit_models.append({
			'sensor_num': sensor_num,
			'model': model,
			'input_scaler': input_scaler,
			'output_scaler': output_scaler
		})
	
	# Save polyfit coefficients to CSV
	polyfit_df = pd.DataFrame(polyfit_coefficients)
	polyfit_df.to_csv(get_data_filepath(COEFFICIENTS_POLYFIT_DIR), index=False)
	
	# Optionally, save neural fit models (requires serialization, e.g., using pickle or TensorFlow's save functions)
	# For simplicity, we'll skip saving models here and assume they're held in memory
	return polyfit_coefficients, neural_fit_models
```

#### **2. Applying Calibration:**

Create separate functions to apply polyfit and neural fit calibrations:

```python
def apply_calibration_coefficients(polyfit_coefficients, neural_fit_models):
    """
    Apply calibration coefficients to aligned Arduino data and save calibrated data.
    """
    for poly_coeff, neural_model in zip(polyfit_coefficients, neural_fit_models):
        sensor_num = poly_coeff['sensor_num']

        # Load aligned Arduino data
        aligned_arduino_data = read_csv(get_data_filepath(ALIGNED_ARDUINO_DIR, sensor_num))

        # Apply Polyfit Calibration
        arduino_raw_force = aligned_arduino_data[f"ADC{'' if SIMPLIFY else sensor_num}"].values
        calibrated_polyfit_force = poly_coeff['m'] * arduino_raw_force + poly_coeff['b']
        aligned_arduino_data[f"Calibrated_Force_Polyfit_{sensor_num}"] = calibrated_polyfit_force

        # Apply Neural Fit Calibration
        model = neural_model['model']
        input_scaler = neural_model['input_scaler']
        output_scaler = neural_model['output_scaler']
        arduino_raw_force_scaled = input_scaler.transform(arduino_raw_force.reshape(-1, 1))
        calibrated_neural_force_scaled = model.predict(arduino_raw_force_scaled)
        calibrated_neural_force = output_scaler.inverse_transform(calibrated_neural_force_scaled).flatten()
        aligned_arduino_data[f"Calibrated_Force_NeuralFit_{sensor_num}"] = calibrated_neural_force

        # Save calibrated data
        aligned_arduino_data.to_csv(get_data_filepath(CALIBRATED_DIR, sensor_num), index=False)
```

#### **3. Analyzing and Graphing Residuals:**

Ensure that both calibration methods are analyzed under identical conditions:

```python
def analyze_and_graph_residuals_single_pdf(test_range, calibration_method='polyfit'):
	"""
    Analyze and visualize residuals for a specified calibration method across multiple tests.
    
    Parameters:

By adhering to these guidelines, you'll establish a robust framework for calibrating your sensors using both polyfit and neural fit methods.
This approach ensures that your comparisons are valid, accurate, and meaningful, providing solid evidence for your paper on which
calibration method performs better under your specific conditions.

Feel free to reach out if you need further assistance with specific implementation details or encounter challenges during your calibration
process!

Your understanding of how **polynomial orders** work in the calibration process is on the right track, but let's clarify and refine the
concepts to ensure accuracy. Here's a detailed breakdown of how polynomial orders are typically applied in calibration workflows, aligning
with your described plots:

---

## **1. Understanding Polynomial Orders in Calibration**

### **A. What is a Polynomial Order?**

- **Polynomial Order (Degree):** Refers to the highest power of the independent variable (e.g., sensor reading) in the polynomial equation
  used for fitting the data.
    - **1st Order (Linear):** \( y = mx + b \)
    - **2nd Order (Quadratic):** \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \)
    - **3rd Order (Cubic):** \( y = dx^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \)
    - And so on...

### **B. Purpose of Using Higher-Order Polynomials:**

- **Capturing Non-Linearity:** Higher-order polynomials can model more complex relationships between the sensor readings and the reference
  measurements (Instron readings).
- **Reducing Residual Errors:** By increasing the order, you can often reduce the residual (difference) between the fitted curve and the
  actual data points, leading to a more accurate calibration.

---

## **2. Step-by-Step Calibration Workflow Using Polynomial Orders**

### **A. First Plot: Instron Reading vs. Pressure Sensor Reading (1st Order)**

- **Objective:** Fit a **linear** relationship between the raw sensor data and the Instron readings.
- **Method:**
    1. **Plot Data:** Scatter plot of Instron force (\( y \)) vs. Sensor ADC values (\( x \)).
    2. **Fit 1st Order Polynomial:** Use linear regression to find the best-fit line \( y = mx + b \).
    3. **Plot Fit:** Overlay the linear fit on the scatter plot.
- **Interpretation:**
    - **Straight Line:** Indicates a linear relationship.
    - **Residuals:** Calculate \( \text{Residual} = y_{\text{Instron}} - y_{\text{Sensor Fit}} \).

### **B. Second Plot: Residuals After 1st Order Fit (Detecting 2nd Order Trends)**

- **Objective:** Analyze the residuals to identify any systematic patterns that a linear fit might have missed.
- **Method:**
    1. **Calculate Residuals:** \( \text{Residual} = y_{\text{Instron}} - (mx + b) \).
    2. **Plot Residuals:** Scatter plot of Instron force vs. residuals.
    3. **Detect Patterns:** Look for curvature or trends suggesting non-linearity.
- **Interpretation:**
    - **Systematic Patterns (e.g., Curvature):** Suggest that a higher-order polynomial may better capture the relationship.

### **C. Third Plot: Calibrated Data Using 2nd Order Polynomial (Addressing 2nd Order Trends)**

- **Objective:** Fit a **quadratic** relationship to better model the data and reduce residual errors.
- **Method:**
    1. **Fit 2nd Order Polynomial:** \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \).
    2. **Plot Fit:** Overlay the quadratic fit on the original scatter plot.
    3. **Calculate New Residuals:** \( \text{Residual} = y_{\text{Instron}} - (ax^2 + bx + c) \).
    4. **Plot New Residuals:** Scatter plot to check for remaining patterns.
- **Interpretation:**
    - **Improved Fit:** Residuals should show less systematic error.
    - **Remaining Patterns:** May indicate the need for even higher-order polynomials.

### **D. Subsequent Plots: Residuals After Higher-Order Fits**

- **Objective:** Continue fitting higher-order polynomials (3rd, 4th, etc.) until residuals no longer show systematic patterns.
- **Method:**
    1. **Fit Higher-Order Polynomials:** Incrementally increase the polynomial degree.
    2. **Plot Fits and Residuals:** Assess improvements at each step.
- **Interpretation:**
    - **Diminishing Returns:** Higher-order fits may capture complex patterns but risk overfitting.
    - **Optimal Order:** Balance between fit accuracy and model simplicity.

## **3. Clarifying Your Described Workflow**

Based on your description:

1. **First Plot:**
    - **Instron vs. Sensor Reading:**
        - **Action:** Fit a straight line (1st order polynomial).
        - **Outcome:** Establishes a baseline linear calibration.

2. **Second Plot:**
    - **Difference (Residuals):**
        - **Action:** Plot residuals after the linear fit.
        - **Observation:** Detects if there's a 2nd order trend (quadratic pattern) in the residuals.

3. **Third Plot:**
    - **Calibrate Out 2nd Order:**
        - **Action:** Fit a 2nd order polynomial and plot residuals.
        - **Expectation:** Residuals might show 3rd order trends if needed.

### **Is This How Orders Work?**

**Yes, with Clarifications:**

- **Orders Represent Polynomial Degrees:** Each "order" corresponds to the degree of the polynomial used for fitting.

- **Sequential Improvement:**
    - **Start with Lower Orders:** Begin with simpler models (e.g., linear).
    - **Analyze Residuals:** Use residual plots to identify patterns indicating the need for higher-order models.
    - **Increment Orders as Needed:** Fit higher-degree polynomials to capture more complex relationships.

- **Residuals Reflect Uncaptured Variations:**
    - **1st Order Fit Residuals:** If residuals show curvature, it indicates that the linear model didn't capture the relationship fully.
    - **2nd Order Fit Residuals:** If residuals still show systematic patterns, a quadratic model may still be insufficient.

**Important Considerations:**

1. **Avoid Overfitting:**
    - **Higher-Order Risks:** While higher-degree polynomials can fit the training data better, they may not generalize well to new data.
    - **Model Complexity:** Use the simplest model that adequately captures the relationship.

2. **Validation:**
    - **Hold-Out Set:** Use a separate validation or test set to assess the calibration model's performance.
    - **Cross-Validation:** Employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.

3. **Visualization:**
    - **Residual Analysis:** Continuously monitor residual plots after each fitting step to decide if further polynomial degrees are
      necessary.
    - **Consistency:** Ensure that residuals are randomly scattered around zero without discernible patterns.

## **4. Applying This Understanding to Your Workflow**

Given your existing workflow, here's how you can integrate and apply polynomial order concepts effectively:

### **A. Calibration Functions Modification:**

1. **Implement Sequential Polynomial Fits:**
    - **Start with Linear Fit:**
      ```python
      m, b = np.polyfit(arduino_raw_force, instron_force, 1)
      calibrated_force_linear = m * arduino_raw_force + b
      ```
    - **Calculate Residuals:**
      ```python
      residuals_linear = instron_force - calibrated_force_linear
      ```
    - **Assess Residuals:**
        - Plot residuals to check for patterns indicating the need for a quadratic fit.

2. **Proceed to Quadratic Fit if Needed:**
    - **Fit Quadratic Polynomial:**
      ```python
      coefficients_quadratic = np.polyfit(arduino_raw_force, instron_force, 2)
      calibrated_force_quadratic = np.polyval(coefficients_quadratic, arduino_raw_force)
      ```
    - **Calculate New Residuals:**
      ```python
      residuals_quadratic = instron_force - calibrated_force_quadratic
      ```
    - **Plot and Assess:**
        - If residuals still show patterns, consider a cubic fit.

3. **Continue as Necessary:**
    - **Cubic Fit Example:**
      ```python
      coefficients_cubic = np.polyfit(arduino_raw_force, instron_force, 3)
      calibrated_force_cubic = np.polyval(coefficients_cubic, arduino_raw_force)
      residuals_cubic = instron_force - calibrated_force_cubic
      ```

### **B. Integrate Polynomial Fits into Your Calibration Process:**

Modify your calibration functions to include multiple polynomial orders and compare their performance.

```python
def calculate_and_apply_polynomial_calibration(sensor_num, max_order=3):
    # Load aligned data
    instron_data = pd.read_csv(get_data_filepath(ALIGNED_INSTRON_DIR, sensor_num))
    aligned_arduino_data = pd.read_csv(get_data_filepath(ALIGNED_ARDUINO_DIR, sensor_num))
    
    instron_force = instron_data["Force [N]"].values
    arduino_raw_force = aligned_arduino_data[f"ADC{'' if SIMPLIFY else sensor_num}"].values
    
    min_length = min(len(instron_force), len(arduino_raw_force))
    instron_force = instron_force[:min_length]
    arduino_raw_force = arduino_raw_force[:min_length]
    
    best_order = 1
    best_rmse = float('inf')
    best_coefficients = None
    best_calibrated_force = None
    
    for order in range(1, max_order + 1):
        # Fit polynomial
        coefficients = np.polyfit(arduino_raw_force, instron_force, order)
        calibrated_force = np.polyval(coefficients, arduino_raw_force)
        
        # Calculate RMSE
        residuals = instron_force - calibrated_force
        rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean(residuals**2))
        
        print(f"Order {order} fit RMSE: {rmse}")
        
        # Select the best fit based on RMSE
        if rmse < best_rmse:
            best_rmse = rmse
            best_order = order
            best_coefficients = coefficients
            best_calibrated_force = calibrated_force
    
    print(f"Best polynomial order: {best_order} with RMSE: {best_rmse}")
    
    # Apply the best fit to calibrate Arduino data
    aligned_arduino_data[f"Calibrated_Force_Polyfit_Order_{best_order}_{sensor_num}"] = best_calibrated_force
    aligned_arduino_data.to_csv(get_data_filepath(CALIBRATED_DIR, sensor_num), index=False)
    
    return best_order, best_coefficients, best_rmse
```

### **C. Comparing Polyfit and Neural Fit:**

To ensure a fair comparison, follow these steps:

1. **Perform Polyfit Calibration:**
    - Fit multiple polynomial orders and select the best based on RMSE.
    - Apply the best polynomial fit to calibrate the sensor data.

2. **Perform Neural Fit Calibration:**
    - Train a neural network using the same aligned and preprocessed data.
    - Apply the neural network to calibrate the sensor data.

3. **Evaluate Both Methods:**
    - **Quantitative Metrics:** Compare RMSE, MAE, and other relevant metrics.
    - **Residual Analysis:** Plot residuals for both methods to visually assess performance.
    - **Visualization:** Overlay calibrated data from both methods on the same plot for direct comparison.

### **D. Example Integration in Your Workflow:**

Modify your main workflow script to include both calibration methods and their evaluations.

```python
from Sensor_Graphs import *
from Calibration_Functions import calculate_calibration_coefficients, apply_calibration_coefficients, analyze_and_graph_residuals_single_pdf


# Define test range
STARTING_TEST = 9
ENDING_TEST = 13
TEST_RANGE = range(STARTING_TEST, ENDING_TEST + 1)

# Step 1: Preprocessing
# Uncomment and run all preprocessing steps as needed
# write_raw_data_to_csv()
# align_data()
# trim_front_of_data(-0.001)
# truncate_data(-0.99)

# Step 2: Calculate Calibration Coefficients (Both Polyfit and Neural Fit)
polyfit_coefficients, neural_fit_models = calculate_calibration_coefficients()

# Step 3: Apply Calibration Coefficients
apply_calibration_coefficients(polyfit_coefficients, neural_fit_models)

# Step 4: Analyze Residuals for Polyfit
analyze_and_graph_residuals_single_pdf(test_range=TEST_RANGE, calibration_method='polyfit')

# Step 5: Analyze Residuals for Neural Fit
analyze_and_graph_residuals_single_pdf(test_range=TEST_RANGE, calibration_method='neuralfit')

# Step 6: Additional Analysis and Graphing as Needed
# Example:
# graph_sensor_average_best_fit()
# graph_sensor_average_error()
# ...
```

## **5. Additional Clarifications and Best Practices**

### **A. Polynomial Order Selection:**

- **Balance Complexity and Performance:**
    - **Low Orders (1st, 2nd):** Simpler models with lower risk of overfitting.
    - **Higher Orders (>3):** Can capture complex relationships but may overfit, especially with noisy data.
- **Use Validation Data:**
    - Evaluate performance on unseen data to select the optimal polynomial order.

### **B. Neural Network Calibration:**

- **Architecture Tuning:**
    - Experiment with different numbers of layers, units, activation functions, etc., to find the best-performing model.
- **Regularization:**
    - Use dropout, L2 regularization, or other techniques to prevent overfitting.
- **Training Monitoring:**
    - Implement early stopping based on validation loss to avoid overfitting.

### **C. Residual Analysis:**

- **Random Scatter:**
    - Ideal residuals should be randomly scattered around zero with no discernible patterns.
- **Systematic Patterns:**
    - Indicate that the model isn't capturing some aspect of the data, suggesting the need for a higher-order fit or a different model type.

### **D. Visualization Tips:**

- **Overlay Plots:**
    - Plot raw data, fitted lines (polyfit and neural fit), and residuals on the same or separate plots for clear comparison.
- **Color Coding and Legends:**
    - Use distinct colors and clear legends to differentiate between methods and orders.

### **E. Avoiding Common Pitfalls:**

- **Overfitting:**
    - Higher-order polynomials can fit the training data perfectly but perform poorly on new data.
- **Underfitting:**
    - Low-order polynomials may not capture the true relationship, leading to high residuals.
- **Data Alignment:**
    - Ensure that each Arduino reading aligns accurately with the corresponding Instron measurement to prevent misleading calibration
      results.

---

## **6. Summary**

Your calibration workflow involves:

1. **Fitting Polynomial Models (Polyfit):**
    - Start with a linear fit.
    - Analyze residuals to detect the need for higher-order polynomials.
    - Incrementally increase the polynomial order to improve fit accuracy.

2. **Training Neural Networks (Neural Fit):**
    - Use aligned and preprocessed data to train neural networks.
    - Compare their performance against polynomial fits using the same metrics and data splits.

3. **Comparing Methods:**
    - Use consistent preprocessing and evaluation criteria.
    - Evaluate both methods using quantitative metrics (e.g., RMSE) and qualitative assessments (residual plots).

4. **Visualization:**
    - Generate plots for both methods to visually compare calibration accuracy.
    - Use residual plots to identify any remaining systematic errors.

By following this structured approach, you'll ensure that your comparison between polyfit and neural fit is **fair, accurate, and meaningful
**, providing strong evidence for your paper regarding which calibration method performs better under your specific conditions.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific implementation details, feel free to ask!

Your workflow and understanding are progressing well, and you're making thoughtful considerations for your paper. Let's address each of your
questions systematically to ensure clarity and accuracy in your calibration and analysis process.

---

## **1. Validating Your Plot Sequence and Understanding Polynomial Orders**

### **Your Proposed Plot Sequence:**

1. **First Plot:** *Instron reading vs. Pressure sensor reading (straight line)*
2. **Second Plot:** *Take the difference of the two (see the second order)*
3. **Third Plot:** *After you calibrate out the second order (you see the third order?)*

### **Is This Accurate?**

**Yes, with Clarifications.** Your sequence aligns with standard practices in calibration using polynomial fits. Here's a detailed
explanation:

### **A. First Plot: Instron Reading vs. Pressure Sensor Reading (1st Order)**

- **Objective:** Establish a **linear relationship** between the raw sensor data (Pressure sensor reading) and the reference measurements (
  Instron reading).

- **Process:**
    1. **Scatter Plot:** Plot Instron force (\( y \)) against Pressure sensor ADC values (\( x \)).
    2. **Linear Fit (1st Order Polynomial):** Fit a straight line \( y = mx + b \) using `np.polyfit(x, y, 1)`.
    3. **Overlay Fit:** Display the linear fit on the scatter plot.

- **Interpretation:**
    - A good linear fit suggests a direct proportional relationship.
    - **Residuals Analysis:** Calculate residuals \( r = y_{\text{Instron}} - y_{\text{Sensor Fit}} \).

### **B. Second Plot: Residuals After 1st Order Fit (Detecting 2nd Order Trends)**

- **Objective:** Identify any **systematic patterns** or **curvatures** in the residuals that indicate the linear model didn't fully capture
  the relationship.

- **Process:**
    1. **Residual Calculation:** \( r = y_{\text{Instron}} - (mx + b) \).
    2. **Residual Plot:** Plot residuals \( r \) against Instron force or sensor reading.
    3. **Pattern Detection:** Look for trends such as curvature, which suggests non-linearity.

- **Interpretation:**
    - **No Pattern:** Linear fit is sufficient.
    - **Curved Pattern:** Indicates the need for a higher-order polynomial (e.g., 2nd order).

### **C. Third Plot: Calibration Using 2nd Order Polynomial (Addressing 2nd Order Trends)**

- **Objective:** Improve the fit by accounting for **quadratic** relationships, thereby reducing residuals.

- **Process:**
    1. **Quadratic Fit (2nd Order Polynomial):** Fit \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) using `np.polyfit(x, y, 2)`.
    2. **Overlay Fit:** Display the quadratic fit on the original scatter plot.
    3. **New Residuals Calculation:** \( r = y_{\text{Instron}} - (ax^2 + bx + c) \).
    4. **Residual Plot:** Plot the new residuals to check for further patterns.

- **Interpretation:**
    - **Improved Residuals:** Indicates a better fit.
    - **Remaining Patterns:** May necessitate an even higher-order polynomial (e.g., 3rd order).

### **D. Subsequent Plots: Residuals After Higher-Order Fits**

- **Objective:** Continue refining the fit by introducing higher-order polynomials until residuals show no systematic patterns.

- **Process:**
    1. **Higher-Order Fit (3rd, 4th Order, etc.):** Incrementally increase the polynomial degree.
    2. **Overlay Fits and Residuals:** Assess each fit's improvement.
    3. **Stop Criteria:** When residuals are randomly scattered without discernible patterns.

- **Important Considerations:**
    - **Avoid Overfitting:** Higher-degree polynomials can fit noise, reducing generalizability.
    - **Balance Complexity and Accuracy:** Use the simplest model that adequately captures the relationship.

## **2. Boxcar Averaging/Smoothing: When and How to Apply**

### **A. Understanding Boxcar Averaging/Smoothing**

**Boxcar Averaging (Moving Average):** A simple smoothing technique that replaces each data point with the average of its neighboring points
within a specified window. This method helps reduce noise and smooth out short-term fluctuations.

### **B. Calibration vs. Final Analysis: Where to Apply Smoothing**

**1. Calibration Phase:**

- **Objective:** Develop accurate calibration models (polyfit and neural fit) by learning the true relationship between sensor readings and
  reference measurements.

- **Recommendation:** **Apply Smoothing Before Calibration.**

    - **Reasoning:**
        - **Noise Reduction:** Smoothing reduces random noise, allowing the calibration models to learn the underlying true relationship
          more effectively.
        - **Improved Fit Quality:** Both polyfit and neural fit can achieve better accuracy with cleaner data.
        - **Consistent Training:** Ensures that both models are trained on equally preprocessed data, maintaining fairness in comparison.

- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  # Example: Applying Boxcar Averaging Before Calibration
  smoothed_instron_force = apply_smoothing(instron_force, method="boxcar", window_size=100, poly_order=None)
  smoothed_arduino_force = apply_smoothing(arduino_raw_force, method="boxcar", window_size=100, poly_order=None)
  ```

**2. Final Analysis Phase:**

- **Objective:** Evaluate the performance of calibration models by analyzing residuals and errors.

- **Recommendation:** **Apply Smoothing After Calibration (if needed).**

    - **Reasoning:**
        - **Residual Analysis Clarity:** Smoothing residuals can help highlight systematic errors or trends.
        - **Presentation Quality:** Smoother residual plots can make it easier to interpret and present findings.

- **Implementation:**
  ```python
  # Example: Applying Boxcar Averaging After Calibration
  residuals = instron_force - calibrated_force
  smoothed_residuals = apply_smoothing(residuals, method="boxcar", window_size=100, poly_order=None)
  ```

### **C. Implications of Applying Boxcar Averaging Before vs. After Calibration**

**1. Smoothing Before Calibration:**

- **Pros:**
    - **Enhanced Model Training:** Models learn from cleaner data, potentially leading to better generalization.
    - **Reduced Noise Impact:** Minimizes the influence of transient fluctuations on calibration parameters.

- **Cons:**
    - **Data Loss:** Smoothing can slightly distort data, especially near edges.
    - **Potential Underfitting:** Excessive smoothing might remove subtle patterns necessary for accurate calibration.

**2. Smoothing After Calibration:**

- **Pros:**
    - **Clear Residual Patterns:** Easier to identify systematic errors without random noise interference.
    - **Enhanced Visualization:** Makes plots more presentable and easier to interpret.

- **Cons:**
    - **Residual Distortion:** Smoothing residuals can mask localized discrepancies that might be important.
    - **Misleading Interpretation:** Over-smoothing can obscure real issues in the calibration.

### **D. Current Implementation Check**

**Are You Currently Doing Boxcar Averaging?**

Based on your provided workflow and code snippets, **Yes**, you are applying boxcar averaging **after calibration**, specifically on the
residuals during analysis phases. Here's how:

```python
# In your analysis functions
residuals_smoothed = apply_smoothing(residuals, method=smoothing_method, window_size=window_size, poly_order=poly_order)
```

This indicates that smoothing is applied during the **final analysis**, not during the **calibration** phase.

## **3. Comparing the 8 Different Scenarios**

Given your workflow, you aim to compare **Polyfit vs. Neural Fit** and **Boxcar Averaging vs. No Boxcar Averaging**, resulting in **4
primary scenarios**. However, considering calibration and final analysis as separate stages, you expand this to **8 scenarios**:

### **A. Breakdown of Scenarios:**

1. **Calibration Phase:**
    - **Scenario 1:** Polyfit with Boxcar Averaging
    - **Scenario 2:** Polyfit without Boxcar Averaging
    - **Scenario 3:** Neural Fit with Boxcar Averaging
    - **Scenario 4:** Neural Fit without Boxcar Averaging

2. **Final Analysis Phase:**
    - **Scenario 5:** Polyfit Calibration + Boxcar Averaging Residuals
    - **Scenario 6:** Polyfit Calibration + No Boxcar Averaging Residuals
    - **Scenario 7:** Neural Fit Calibration + Boxcar Averaging Residuals
    - **Scenario 8:** Neural Fit Calibration + No Boxcar Averaging Residuals

### **B. Detailed Comparison:**

#### **1. Calibration Phase Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 1:** **Polyfit with Boxcar Averaging**
    - **Process:**
        - Apply boxcar averaging to both Instron and Arduino data before fitting a polynomial.
        - Fit a polynomial (varying orders) to the smoothed data.

- **Scenario 2:** **Polyfit without Boxcar Averaging**
    - **Process:**
        - Use raw, unsmoothed data to fit a polynomial.

- **Scenario 3:** **Neural Fit with Boxcar Averaging**
    - **Process:**
        - Apply boxcar averaging to both Instron and Arduino data before training the neural network.
        - Train the neural network on smoothed data.

- **Scenario 4:** **Neural Fit without Boxcar Averaging**
    - **Process:**
        - Use raw, unsmoothed data to train the neural network.

#### **2. Final Analysis Phase Scenarios:**

- **Scenario 5:** **Polyfit Calibration + Boxcar Averaging Residuals**
    - **Process:**
        - After calibration using a polynomial fit on smoothed data, calculate residuals.
        - Apply boxcar averaging to residuals before plotting and analysis.

- **Scenario 6:** **Polyfit Calibration + No Boxcar Averaging Residuals**
    - **Process:**
        - Calculate residuals from polynomial calibration without smoothing.

- **Scenario 7:** **Neural Fit Calibration + Boxcar Averaging Residuals**
    - **Process:**
        - After calibration using a neural network on smoothed data, calculate residuals.
        - Apply boxcar averaging to residuals before plotting and analysis.

- **Scenario 8:** **Neural Fit Calibration + No Boxcar Averaging Residuals**
    - **Process:**
        - Calculate residuals from neural network calibration without smoothing.

### **C. Implications and Considerations for Each Scenario:**

1. **Scenarios 1 & 2 (Polyfit Calibration):**
    - **With Averaging:** Potentially better calibration due to reduced noise.
    - **Without Averaging:** Higher noise may affect calibration accuracy.

2. **Scenarios 3 & 4 (Neural Fit Calibration):**
    - **With Averaging:** Neural networks may train more effectively on smoother data, improving generalization.
    - **Without Averaging:** Neural networks might capture noise, leading to overfitting or less robust calibration.

3. **Scenarios 5 & 6 (Polyfit Residuals):**
    - **With Averaging:** Clearer visualization of systematic residuals.
    - **Without Averaging:** Residuals may appear noisy, making pattern detection harder.

4. **Scenarios 7 & 8 (Neural Fit Residuals):**
    - **With Averaging:** Enhanced ability to detect systematic errors in neural calibration.
    - **Without Averaging:** Residuals may mask underlying patterns due to noise.

### **D. Recommendation for Fair Comparison:**

To ensure a **fair and meaningful comparison** across all scenarios:

1. **Consistent Preprocessing:**
    - **Boxcar Averaging:** Apply it uniformly within each scenario's calibration or analysis phase.
    - **No Averaging:** Ensure raw data is handled consistently.

2. **Equal Evaluation Metrics:**
    - Use the same metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) across all scenarios for comparability.

3. **Comprehensive Visualization:**
    - Present plots for each scenario side-by-side to facilitate direct comparison.

4. **Statistical Significance:**
    - Perform statistical tests to determine if differences between scenarios are significant.

---

## **4. Practical Implementation in Your Workflow**

### **A. Structuring Your Workflow for 8 Scenarios**

Given the complexity of handling multiple scenarios, it's essential to structure your code and analysis systematically.

**1. Calibration Function:**

Create a generalized calibration function that accepts parameters for smoothing and calibration method.

```python
def calibrate_sensor(sensor_num, test_range, use_boxcar=False, calibration_method='polyfit', poly_order=1):
	# Load aligned data
	instron_data = pd.read_csv(get_data_filepath(ALIGNED_INSTRON_DIR, sensor_num, _TEST_NUM=_TEST_NUM))
	aligned_arduino_data = pd.read_csv(get_data_filepath(ALIGNED_ARDUINO_DIR, sensor_num, _TEST_NUM=_TEST_NUM))
	
	instron_force = instron_data["Force [N]"].values
	arduino_raw_force = aligned_arduino_data[f"ADC{'' if SIMPLIFY else sensor_num}"].values
	
	min_length = min(len(instron_force), len(arduino_raw_force))
	instron_force = instron_force[:min_length]
	arduino_raw_force = arduino_raw_force[:min_length]
	
	# Apply boxcar averaging if required
	if use_boxcar:
		instron_force = apply_smoothing(instron_force, method="boxcar", window_size=100, poly_order=None)
		arduino_raw_force = apply_smoothing(arduino_raw_force, method="boxcar", window_size=100, poly_order=None)
	
	if calibration_method == 'polyfit':
		coefficients = np.polyfit(arduino_raw_force, instron_force, poly_order)
		calibrated_force = np.polyval(coefficients, arduino_raw_force)
	elif calibration_method == 'neuralfit':
		# Neural fit implementation
		input_scaler = StandardScaler()
		output_scaler = StandardScaler()
		instron_force_scaled = input_scaler.fit_transform(instron_force.reshape(-1, 1))
		arduino_force_scaled = output_scaler.fit_transform(arduino_raw_force.reshape(-1, 1))
		
		model = build_neural_network(input_dim=1, layers=4, units=128, activation='tanh', dropout_rate=0.2, l2_reg=0.0001, learning_rate=0.0001)
		early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='loss', patience=10, restore_best_weights=True)
		model.fit(instron_force_scaled, arduino_force_scaled, epochs=200, batch_size=256, verbose=0, callbacks=[early_stopping])
		
		calibrated_force_scaled = model.predict(instron_force_scaled)
		calibrated_force = output_scaler.inverse_transform(calibrated_force_scaled).flatten()
	else:
		raise ValueError("Invalid calibration method specified.")
	
	return calibrated_force, instron_force
```

**2. Residual Analysis Function:**

Develop a function to compute and optionally smooth residuals.

```python
def analyze_residuals(calibrated_force, instron_force, apply_smoothing=False, smoothing_method='boxcar', window_size=100, poly_order=None):
	residuals = instron_force - calibrated_force
	
	if apply_smoothing:
		residuals = apply_smoothing(residuals, method=smoothing_method, window_size=window_size, poly_order=poly_order)
	
	return residuals
```

**3. Iterating Over Scenarios:**

Loop through each scenario systematically.

```python
import itertools


# Define scenarios
smoothing_options = [True, False]
calibration_methods = ['polyfit', 'neuralfit']
poly_orders = {'polyfit': [1, 2, 3], 'neuralfit': [None]}  # poly_order only relevant for polyfit

# Generate all combinations
scenarios = list(itertools.product(smoothing_options, calibration_methods))

for use_boxcar, calibration_method in scenarios:
	for sensor_num in SENSORS_RANGE:
		for test_num in TEST_RANGE:
			# Calibrate
			calibrated_force, instron_force = calibrate_sensor(sensor_num, test_num, use_boxcar=use_boxcar, calibration_method=calibration_method, poly_order=2 if calibration_method == 'polyfit' else None)
			
			# Analyze residuals
			residuals = analyze_residuals(calibrated_force, instron_force, apply_smoothing=use_boxcar, smoothing_method='boxcar', window_size=100, poly_order=None)
			
			# Plot and save results
			plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
			plt.plot(instron_force, residuals, label=f"Test {test_num}, Sensor {sensor_num}")
			plt.xlabel("Instron Force [N]")
			plt.ylabel("Residual Force [N]")
			plt.title(f"Residuals for {calibration_method} Calibration {'with' if use_boxcar else 'without'} Boxcar Averaging")
			plt.legend()
			plt.grid(True)
			plt.gca().invert_xaxis()
			
			if SAVE_GRAPHS:
				plt.savefig(f"/path/to/save/Residuals_{calibration_method}_Boxcar_{use_boxcar}_Test_{test_num}_Sensor_{sensor_num}.png")
			plt.show()
			plt.close()
```

**4. Evaluation and Comparison:**

After processing all scenarios, compile evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) for each scenario to facilitate comparison.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error


# Example: Storing metrics
metrics = []

for use_boxcar, calibration_method in scenarios:
	for sensor_num in SENSORS_RANGE:
		for test_num in TEST_RANGE:
			calibrated_force, instron_force = calibrate_sensor(sensor_num, test_num, use_boxcar=use_boxcar, calibration_method=calibration_method, poly_order=2 if calibration_method == 'polyfit' else None)
			residuals = analyze_residuals(calibrated_force, instron_force, apply_smoothing=False)  # Smoothing already handled
			rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(instron_force, calibrated_force))
			mae = mean_absolute_error(instron_force, calibrated_force)
			
			metrics.append({
				'Calibration Method': calibration_method,
				'Boxcar Averaging': use_boxcar,
				'Sensor Number': sensor_num,
				'Test Number': test_num,
				'RMSE': rmse,
				'MAE': mae
			})

# Convert to DataFrame for analysis
metrics_df = pd.DataFrame(metrics)

# Example: Grouping and comparing
grouped_metrics = metrics_df.groupby(['Calibration Method', 'Boxcar Averaging']).agg({'RMSE': 'mean', 'MAE': 'mean'})
print(grouped_metrics)
```

## **5. Addressing the Impact of Boxcar Averaging on Calibration and Neural Fit**

### **A. Boxcar Averaging Before Calibration:**

- **Pros:**
    - **Noise Reduction:** Smoother data provides cleaner inputs for both polyfit and neural networks, enhancing calibration accuracy.
    - **Enhanced Model Training:** Neural networks benefit from reduced noise, leading to better generalization and less overfitting.

- **Cons:**
    - **Potential Data Distortion:** Over-smoothing can blur essential features or subtle patterns in the data.
    - **Reduced Responsiveness:** May dampen the model's ability to capture rapid changes or fine-grained relationships.

### **B. Boxcar Averaging After Calibration:**

- **Pros:**
    - **Clearer Residual Analysis:** Smoothing residuals can highlight systematic errors or trends more effectively.

## **6. Recommendations for Your Workflow**

### **A. Calibration Phase: Apply Boxcar Averaging**

1. **Why?**
    - **Cleaner Data for Model Training:** Ensures both polyfit and neural fit models are trained on smooth data, enhancing calibration
      accuracy and fairness in comparison.

2. **How?**
    - **Preprocess Data:** Apply boxcar averaging to both Instron and Arduino data before fitting models.

3. **Implementation:**
   ```python
   if use_boxcar:
       instron_force = apply_smoothing(instron_force, method="boxcar", window_size=100, poly_order=None)
       arduino_raw_force = apply_smoothing(arduino_raw_force, method="boxcar", window_size=100, poly_order=None)
   ```

### **B. Final Analysis Phase: Choose Based on Needs**

1. **Residual Analysis:**
    - **With Smoothing:** If you want clearer residual patterns for reporting, apply boxcar averaging.
    - **Without Smoothing:** To capture all residual variations, keep residuals unsmoothed.

2. **Recommendation:**
    - **Maintain Both Perspectives:** Present both smoothed and unsmoothed residuals to provide a comprehensive analysis.

3. **Implementation:**
   ```python
   residuals = instron_force - calibrated_force
   
   # Without Smoothing
   plot_residuals(instron_force, residuals, label="Unsmoothed Residuals")
   
   # With Smoothing
   residuals_smoothed = apply_smoothing(residuals, method="boxcar", window_size=100, poly_order=None)
   plot_residuals(instron_force[:len(residuals_smoothed)], residuals_smoothed, label="Smoothed Residuals")
   ```

### **C. Structuring the 8 Scenarios for Comparison**

1. **Calibration Methods:**
    - **Polyfit (with varying orders)**
    - **Neural Fit (with varying layers)**

2. **Smoothing Options:**
    - **With Boxcar Averaging**
    - **Without Boxcar Averaging**

3. **Final Analysis Options:**
    - **Residuals Smoothed**
    - **Residuals Unsmoothed**

**Note:** While you initially consider 8 scenarios, focusing on the most impactful comparisons (e.g., with and without smoothing for both
calibration methods) might provide clearer insights.

### **D. Practical Steps to Implement the 8 Scenarios**

1. **Automate Calibration and Analysis:**
    - Use functions that accept parameters for calibration method and smoothing options.

2. **Consistent Evaluation Metrics:**
    - Ensure that all scenarios are evaluated using the same metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

3. **Comprehensive Reporting:**
    - Present results in tables and plots that clearly delineate the impact of calibration methods and smoothing.

4. **Example Code Structure:**

   ```python
   for use_boxcar in [True, False]:
       for calibration_method in ['polyfit', 'neuralfit']:
           for sensor_num in SENSORS_RANGE:
               for test_num in TEST_RANGE:
                   # Calibrate
                   calibrated_force, instron_force = calibrate_sensor(sensor_num, test_num, use_boxcar=use_boxcar, calibration_method=calibration_method, poly_order=2 if calibration_method == 'polyfit' else None)
                   
                   # Analyze Residuals
                   residuals = analyze_residuals(calibrated_force, instron_force, apply_smoothing=False)  # Optionally smooth here
                   
                   # Store Metrics
                   rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(instron_force, calibrated_force))
                   mae = mean_absolute_error(instron_force, calibrated_force)
                   
                   # Append to metrics list
                   metrics.append({
                       'Calibration Method': calibration_method,
                       'Boxcar Averaging': use_boxcar,
                       'Sensor Number': sensor_num,
                       'Test Number': test_num,
                       'RMSE': rmse,
                       'MAE': mae
                   })
                   
                   # Plot Residuals
                   plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
                   plt.plot(instron_force, residuals, label=f"Test {test_num}, Sensor {sensor_num}")
                   plt.xlabel("Instron Force [N]")
                   plt.ylabel("Residual Force [N]")
                   plt.title(f"Residuals for {calibration_method.capitalize()} Calibration {'with' if use_boxcar else 'without'} Boxcar Averaging")
                   plt.legend()
                   plt.grid(True)
                   plt.gca().invert_xaxis()
                   
                   if SAVE_GRAPHS:
                       plt.savefig(f"/path/to/save/Residuals_{calibration_method}_Boxcar_{use_boxcar}_Test_{test_num}_Sensor_{sensor_num}.png")
                   plt.show()
                   plt.close()
   
   # Compile Metrics
   metrics_df = pd.DataFrame(metrics)
   ```
